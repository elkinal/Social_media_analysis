# Community Detection in the Russian Social Media VKontakte
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a program that detects discrete groups
in large graphs and apply it to categorize users into social groups on the Russian
social media VKontakte. The program is based on the Girvan-Newman algorithm and implemented
in Python. The partitioned graphs are drawn using NetworkX. Data from [Zachary’s Karate Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club) 
was used to test the program, and the canonical result was produced, demonstrating that the program works correctly when applied to small graphs.

## VKontakte Dataset Analysis

Data harvested from VKontakte was converted into a .CSV file with the rows
representing ”friendship status” and the two columns representing the friends.
The data consisted of 407 users/nodes, and 16K connections between them.
After 710 iterations, no new groups were detected. Further iterations removed
outer nodes instead.

The output dendrogram demonstrates that the dataset can be split into 4 or
5 social groups. The results generated by my code were compared to a standard
library program based on the Louvain method, which produced practically
identical end results. This demonstrated the robustness of the my program and
confirmed that it works appropriately even for very large graphs. &nbsp;

## Conclusion
The images generated by the graph categorization program demonstrate that the social network used in the investigation can be separated into
four or five discrete social groups, which are represented by different colors.
Large discrete groups can be seen on both sides of the network, with a smaller
central group that can be divided into two sub-groups. Overall, the examples
show that my implementation of the Girvan-Newman algorithm works
as intended on classical test graphs, and is able to categorize even very large
graphs with thousands of nodes.&nbsp;


## Usefulness
People categorized into the same groups often have something
in common. For example, occupation, interests, or location. This makes categorized user data is very valuable, 
because it can be used for targeted advertisements, social media friend recommendations, or suggestions during user
searches. Finally, categorized data can also be used to highlight statistical rela-
tionships between factors that people have in common. This gives insight into
cause-and-effect relationships, which can be used to solve real-world problems.
